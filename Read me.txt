In the zip file, you will find multiple .pt files, these are the NER models trained for radiology NER. 
For best performance, you could use "en_test102_nertagger.pt" which was trained by 400 labeled radiology reports. 


Demo code:

import stanza
nlp = stanza.Pipeline(lang='en', processors={'ner': 'tokenize'}, ner_model_path='saved_models/en_test102_nertagger.pt')
text = xxx.lower("The body of the report")
text = text.replace(", and", "and")
------other preprocessing depends on the task----------
doc = nlp(text)



and you could follow the stanza NER usage page:
